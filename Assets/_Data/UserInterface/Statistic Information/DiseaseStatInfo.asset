  _variable: This symbol represents an Ailment or a Resistance to Disease. "Sick"
    is a Status effect and is displayed when the player's Immune System recieves damage
    from the environment, weapons, armor, items or spells. When the Immune System
    reaches 0 due to Disease, the player will have their maximum Health, Stamina and
    Body Needs reduced to *Half*, meaning they are more likely to be prone to succumbing
    to other environmental hazards. Disease can and should be treated with immediately
    in allies and livestock or they might not survive the night!
