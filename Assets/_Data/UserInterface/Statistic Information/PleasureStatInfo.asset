  _variable: A Body Need the player must maintain both for themselves and for each
    of their livestock. If Pleasure reaches 0, the player will start losing Courage.
    Keeping high Pleasure in livestock allows for the potential of new livestock to
    be born, higher yields in products and better cooperation with the player and
    vice versa. Bear in mind allies and enemies also need Pleasure, so play to their
    likes and dislikes to gain the upper hand.
