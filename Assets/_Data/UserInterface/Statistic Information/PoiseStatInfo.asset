  _variable: Reflects the ability for the player not to be staggered by an attack
    or to dodge succesfully.                                                          The
    current amount of Poise the player is currently facing     /     The total amount
    of Poise the player can withstand.                    If this fills up, the player
    will more likely be interrupted during attacks or dodges.
