  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  _variable: The total amount of confidence the player has. Depending of the value,
    the player may percieve the world differently, gaining abilities when this value
    is at its highest or losing abilities at its lowest. Certain enemies or allies,
    once their courage reaches 0 will respond differently to situations. Courage degrades
    overtime and more quickly in stressful situations such as combat, however it can
    be restored through items or interactions with other beings.
