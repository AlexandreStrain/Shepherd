  _variable: A Body Need the player must maintain both for themselves and for each
    of their livestock. If Sleep reaches 0, the player's Stamina will also be 0. Normally,
    Sleep refills back to full with each new day, however if they continue to push
    themselves beyond the typical sleep schedule they will more likely affect their
    Health, Stamina, Attributes, Immune System and Courage.
