  _variable: The total amount of protection the player has against the ailments of
    the world. The ability for the body to fight back against the entropy of its environment
    is a fickle process, and requires careful maintaining in order to survive. This
    value can be brought low from a multitude of sources, however once this value
    reaches 0 the ailment that brought it there becomes the player's affliction and
    changes their Status. It is only until this bar reaches full does the ailment
    go away. The Immune System regenerates slowly over time, and can be affected by
    items. Maintaining a full bar regenerates lost Health.
